# Quarkus Release Scripts

These scripts are used to release [Quarkus](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus),
the framework for Supersonic Subatomic Java.

These scripts shouldn't be used locally and releases should be done
by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/quarkus-release/release)
so that the [automatic release workflow](https://github.com/quarkusio/conversational-release-action)
orchestrates the scripts.

These scripts are the ones orchestrated by the automatic release workflow though
so they are indeed still used to release Quarkus.

We also make sure that we can still [release manually](MANUAL_RELEASE.md) if need be,
even if it is strongly discouraged.
